Problem Statement

Lets learn about a new datatype 'sets'! You are given two set of integers M and N and you have to print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The first line of input contains value of M followed by M integers, then value of N followed by N integers. Symmetric difference between M and N mean those values which either exist in M or in N but not in both.

Input Format

Value of M followed by M integers, then value of N followed by N integers.

Output Format

Integers in ascending order, one per line.
